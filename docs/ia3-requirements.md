# IA#3 — API contract: the agent implements it, the tests judge · rubric

_Class 23KTPM1_

**CSC13114 · individual assignment · 2% of the course · 100 points**

Session 5, started in the room and finished at home. Start from the starter repository linked in this assignment (github.com/fithcmus/awad-api-contract-starter). Its `README.md` gives the steps; `CONTRACT.md` is the specification your agent implements.

Use your assistant. Nothing in this assignment asks you to type code yourself: it scores what the API does, what you predicted and checked before you trusted the agent, and how you handled the sentences of the contract that could be read two ways.

**Due Thursday, November 12, 2026, 22:00**. Done alone — this is not team work. Write `NOTES.md`, `AI-LOG.md` and `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` in English.

## What you hand in

One zip of your repository, including `.git`, so that the order of your commits can be read. A history rebased, squashed or rebuilt after the work was finished does not count as commit order: criteria 3 and 4 then score at their levels for predictions written after the first run and for a `contract-run-1.txt` re-run after fixes. It must contain:

| File                                          | What it is                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/v1.js`, `src/app.js`, `migrations/002_*` | the `/v1` implementation your agent wrote, with your fixes                                    |
| `contract-run-1.txt`                          | `npm run contract 2>&1 \| tee contract-run-1.txt` — the agent's first attempt, before any fix |
| `contract-run-final.txt`                      | the same command after your last fix                                                          |
| `NOTES.md`                                    | your predictions, the failures and the ambiguous sentences (criteria 3–5)                     |
| `AI-LOG.md`                                   | as for every assignment                                                                       |
| `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md`                   | see _How to submit_                                                                           |

Leave out `node_modules/` (there is none) and `data/`.

## What is scored

| #   | Criterion                                 | Points |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | The contract tests pass                   | 30     |
| 2   | The rules were kept                       | 10     |
| 3   | Predictions, made before the agent ran    | 10     |
| 4   | The first run, read line by line          | 20     |
| 5   | The sentences that could be read two ways | 20     |
| 6   | `AI-LOG.md`                               | 10     |

## 1. The contract tests pass — 30 points

We unzip your repository and run `npm run migrate && npm run seed && npm test && npm run contract` on Node 22.13 or later. The score comes from our run; `contract-run-final.txt` must match it.

| Points | What it looks like                                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 30     | Legacy 3 of 3 and contract 29 of 29, and `contract-run-final.txt` shows the same.        |
| 20–29  | Legacy 3 of 3, contract 25–28 of 29. One point fewer for each failing test below 29.     |
| 10–19  | Legacy 3 of 3, contract 15–24 of 29.                                                     |
| 0–9    | Fewer than 15 contract tests pass, the legacy tests fail, or the service does not start. |

If our run and `contract-run-final.txt` disagree, we score our run and say so in the feedback.

## 2. The rules were kept — 10 points

Checked with `git diff` against the starter commit.

| Points | What it looks like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10     | Nothing under `test/` and nothing in `CONTRACT.md` changed. Every new table is in a new `migrations/002_*.up.sql` with a matching `.down.sql`.                                                                                                           |
| 5–9    | One of: a new table created outside a migration, or a migration with no `down`.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 0      | `test/` or `CONTRACT.md` was changed — and criterion 1 is then scored 0 as well, since a test that was edited to pass no longer judges anything. If you think a test or the contract is wrong, write it in `NOTES.md`: that is a finding, not a failure. |

## 3. Predictions, made before the agent ran — 10 points

| Points | What it looks like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9–10   | `NOTES.md` names two sentences of `CONTRACT.md`, quoted or with their section number, that you expected the agent to get wrong, each with a reason. The commit that adds them comes before the first commit that changes `src/`. At the end, one line per prediction says whether it came true. |
| 5–8    | Two predictions, but one has no reason, or the outcome is not recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1–4    | Predictions written after the first run (the commit order shows it), or only one.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 0      | None.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## 4. The first run, read line by line — 20 points

| Points | What it looks like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 17–20  | `contract-run-1.txt` is committed before any commit that fixes `src/` after the agent's first attempt. `NOTES.md` has one line per test that failed in it: the sentence of the contract, what the agent did instead, and — when the sentence could be read two ways — the wording you would change it to. |
| 11–16  | Every failure has a line, but some only repeat the test name without saying what the agent did.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4–10   | Only some failures are explained, or `contract-run-1.txt` was clearly re-run after fixes (fewer failures than the commits show).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 0–3    | No `contract-run-1.txt`, or no explanation of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If the agent's first attempt passed all 29 tests, say so: this criterion is then scored on criterion 5's list instead — pick the three points the agent said it guessed at and explain each one the same way.

## 5. The sentences that could be read two ways — 20 points

You asked the agent: "Which sentences of `CONTRACT.md` could be read two ways, and what did you choose for each?" A green run does not mean the contract is complete — only that the tests found nothing.

| Points | What it looks like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 17–20  | The agent's answer is in `NOTES.md` (pasted or summarised). For each point: the section, the two readings, the one you chose and why, and the sentence you would add to `CONTRACT.md`. At least one point is one the agent did not list — found by you. |
| 11–16  | Every point from the agent has a decision and a proposed sentence; none found by you.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4–10   | The agent's list is pasted with no decision, or decisions with no proposed wording.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 0–3    | Missing, or "no ambiguities" accepted without checking.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 6. AI-LOG.md — 10 points

| Points | What it looks like                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9–10   | The prompt you handed over and every fix prompt are logged. Fix prompts name the test and the contract section, not test code. Changed and Rejected are real: at least one thing the agent wrote that you did not keep, and why. |
| 5–8    | Prompts logged, but a fix prompt pastes test code, or Rejected is empty.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 1–4    | A summary with no prompts.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 0      | No `AI-LOG.md`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## How to submit

One zip file, named after your student ID and the total you give yourself: `<StudentID>_<total>.zip`, for example `23127001_82.zip`. Turn it in from your `<StudentID>@student.hcmus.edu.vn` Google account.

The zip must contain `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md`: one row per criterion in this rubric, the marks you claim, and evidence pointing at a file, a commit, a test name or a section of `NOTES.md` — plus a short _what I did not manage_. The total in that table is the number in the file name. Template on Classroom.

A wrong file name costs no marks but delays your result — the grading script matches submissions to the class list by that name.

## Honesty adjustment

Your self-assessment is compared with the mark you actually earn. The gap is your total − the mark, on the same 100-point scale.

| Gap                            | Adjustment                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| within ±10                     | none — this is normal calibration                   |
| +11 to +20                     | −3                                                  |
| +21 to +30                     | −6                                                  |
| more than +30                  | −10                                                 |
| −21 or worse                   | −3 — read the rubric before you score yourself down |
| no `SELF_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` | −10, and the file-name total is ignored             |

A criterion you claim with no evidence line counts as claimed-and-not-done for this comparison. The adjustment never takes a submission below 0.
